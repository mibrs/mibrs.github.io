## Welcome

This website features primarily materials on Alice 3, but also a bit about other content.

and will be continuously upgraded throughout the school year 2023/24.

The website provides materials to learn about these applications. Furthermore, you find links to repositories  with further code and assets. The course the posts are derived from is held every year, every time there are adjustments and changes that reflect the feedback from previous courses and new insights into the subject.

Enjoy and be creative!

Michael
