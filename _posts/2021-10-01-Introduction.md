This blog is an example on how students can publish and share content using Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Some posts share the actual content, others introduce basics on how to create posts or describe intermediate topics as integration of audio, image, video, HTML. As the blog is public, feel free to check the source code in the repository.

The content here is related to my extracurricular activities "Creative Computing" held at the French Internatinal School in Hong Kong. The activities cover the following tools and applications.

- Audacity (audio recording)
- MAX 8 (multimedia creation)
- Alice 3 (3D animation)
- HTML/CSS coding (web design)
- P5.JS (Javascript library and online IDE for artists)
- Lego Mindstorms EV-3 (robotics)
- VEX IQ (robotics)
- Fischertechnik Robo TXT and others (robotics and engineering)

The activities are described from a student's perspective as a learning log, if you are looking for more information please check out my site [michaelsposts](https://michaelsposts.com).

Enjoy
