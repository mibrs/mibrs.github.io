### What we did
Little Bit (now belonging to Sphero) offered some years back a Syntheziser Kit designed by Korg. This is a basic analog syntheziser
with a few components (oscillators, filters, ...) that can be assembled as you like to create your unique sound. That's what we have done here.

The photo shows the setup of the modules (including a microphone for recording). The audio file allows you to listen to the short production.
