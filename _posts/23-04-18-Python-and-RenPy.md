This module will cover a basic introduction to Python. 

First, we will use Tigerjython to get some basic knowledge on 

- data handling (variables, assignments)
- flow of a program (sequence) and 
- control structures (loops, conditionals ifs, ...)

Then we will use RenPy to learn about visual stories and create on ourselves.
