## TigerJython - Overview

TigherJython is an integrated development environment (IDE) for learning to code in Python. A basic functionality is available online at [TigherJython Online](https://webtigerjython.ethz.ch) and runs on the web browser, so you can start without the need to install any software . But for faster resonse times and more possibilities it is better to install the program locally on your computer from this site: [TigerJython](https://tigerjython.ch/en).

TigerJython as the name implies is derived from Python, but it is not 100% compatible. It is based on an older standard (Python 2.7), an early learner will not notice the differences. But TigerJython provides helpful support in many areas and makes the learning experience more fun.

The learning experience here is structured as follows:

## Basic Concepts Introduced in Part I:

- Values (numbers, characters and composite values)
- Repetition with ```repeat```
- Libraries and functions
- Parameters as placeholders in functions
- Variables to label and access a memory location to save, recall and change values.
